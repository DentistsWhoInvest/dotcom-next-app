        For example, a few years back I heard a frightening story about heart

      <p>
        This same situation routinely occurs in the investment world… although
        the case can be made that it&apos;s MUCH more common in investing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, several advisory firms have been under the microscope recently

      </p>
      <p>
        Gain an understanding of the investing landscape so you&apos;re equipped
        to ask the questions that will lead to the results you seek.

        So if you ask the wrong questions, you&apos;re gonna get the wrong

      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        So if you don&apos;t know that you can actually bypass using a Financial
        Advisor and avoid recurring high fees…
      </p>
      <p> Then you&apos;d never think to ask:</p>
      <p className="font-semibold italic">
        &lsquo;How can I avoid paying a Financial Advisor high and recurring
        fees?&apos;{" "}
      </p>
      <p>Or… if you didn&apos;t know that you can insure your investments…</p>
      <p>You wouldn&apos;t think to ask: &lsquo;</p>
      <p className="font-semibold italic">
        How can I ensure my nest egg is protected no matter what happens in the

      </p>
      <p>And so on.</p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Now you can see why I always suggest learning the general language and

        See, back in 2018 after putting myself through schooling and in my 2nd

      <p>
        Being the confident 27 year old that I was… I opened up my computer
